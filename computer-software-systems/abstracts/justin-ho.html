            let input = "This project is an internship under Gracetech Services, a non-profit technology services organization. I worked closely with the client, 7 Stages, to develop and update their mobile app with new functionality.The main goals of my internship were to update the app to be more user-friendly and add new features, and to support a new business-to-consumer (B2C) model along with the existing business-to-business (B2B) model. To support the new B2C model, the app was updated with features such as user-created study groups and in-app payment. Additional features were also added to enhance group functionality, such as study progress and attendance.The app communicates with the server using a RESTful API, where the app is responsible for displaying information received from the server. Significant work was done to enhance the system to support the new app functionality. This included creating and modifying database tables, creating and modifying API endpoints, providing migration support for existing endpoints, and updating the app to call new endpoints and display the returned information.The client initially had desired functionality beyond the scope of what was completed. These features were reduced in scope to the current main goals of the project, which were successfully met. The app gained new, user-friendly functionality, and the B2C model was successfully implemented into the app.";
