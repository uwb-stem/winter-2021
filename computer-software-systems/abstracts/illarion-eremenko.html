            let input = "After tutoring for three-four years, I began to realize that the free tutoring colleges offers is sometimes not enough, as students have messaged me for coursework help. At the same time, I saw a disconnect between students at my community college in terms communication between each other outside of school in comparison to UW, and I assume other college campuses struggle with this as well.<br/><br/>After taking all of this into account, I decided to build Gradcent, a platform which advertises student tutors to classmates and any other users such as high schoolers on the platform. It also provides a chat messaging system for college students, organized by institution, curriculum, course, and section. Tutors also have access to a tutoring session tool, allowing them to hold tutoring sessions on the platform. It is a one stop shop for tutors and students.<br/><br/>The result includes a web application located at https://www.gradcent.com , where users can sign up with their college email and get access to the chat.<br/><br/>This should help students with communication outside of college, find tutors easily, and as soon as several other features are implemented, have all the college clubs be at the student's finger tips. Soon, students can have direct communication with their classmates in one chat, and with the professors in another.";
