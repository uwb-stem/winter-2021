            let input = "This capstone is part of a research project that aims to help find blood around the brain using ultrasound images. The task was to create a model that took the ultrasound images formatted as a set of Fourier transforms on a sound wave as an input and outputting where in the images the bleed exists. The output is a probability distribution at every pixel. This model will eventually be used by practitioners in the field to determine if patients in battlefield settings have a chance of survival. If there is too much blood in their brain, there is little to no chance of survival after injury but if there is no blood, there is a high chance of survival.As part of my work, I was able to create an algorithm that outperformed all other algorithms previously generated. I was able to identify many instances of bleed around the skull but identifying bleeds within the brain consistently has been more challenging.  In addition I developed multiple algorithms that had varying levels of success based on successful performances on major benchmark datasets like ImageNet.";
