            let input = "My work towards the Virtual Reality Engineering Education project consisted of creating an immersive environment where a user can perform tensile testing. To create an immersive environment, I had to focus on user interactions with virtual reality (VR) such as being able to physically press a button or being able to place objects inside of machines. For the tensile testing itself, I researched how tensile testing is performed and how data is recorded in order to accurately translate it into a VR setting.The reason for creating an immersive environment for users to conduct tensile tests is so that they can experience tensile testing in a 3D environment without having to spend tens of thousands of dollars on the machine and samples. The user can experience tensile testing as if they were actually conducting it rather than experiencing tensile testing through watching videos.As of now, a user can enter the tensile room and conduct testing. They can spawn a sample using a vending machine, take the sample over to the tensile testing machine and start testing on it while viewing data about the sample in real time. Then they can take the sample over to a table where they can compare the data with other samples. While certain polish is still needed, such as the addition of additional samples, the foundation I created should allow for anyone else working on the tensile room to add polish or additional features with relative ease including users that do not have significant Unity experience.<br/>";

                let linebreak = ".<br/><br/>"
                let replacement = linebreak.concat(foundstr.substr(-1));
                output = input.replace(regex, replacement);
