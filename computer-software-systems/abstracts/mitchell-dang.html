Experience can be soccer training, software training, etc. The business model is similar to Airbnb, but more experience focused.<br></br>The goal of my internship at KyFlex was to improve the current UI/UX to make it more intuitive and engaging, collaborate with frontend and backend team to implement new designs for Payment & Customer's Profile, write, test, and document manageable and scalable code.<br></br>My initial task at KyFlex focused on learning about the frontend team, revising and designing initial interfaces for upcoming features using Figma, setting up the environment and learning to navigate the codebase. As I mastered the tools, I started contributing directly to the final product and implemented new features for customer profile, bookings and payment processing. Although I was part of the frontend team, I also collaborated with backend developers in implementing functionality. I reported two critical bugs, where the system would fail to load valid data, to the backend team.<br></br>Working with a small team of talented engineers and experts in a fast-paced environment, I learned valuable knowledge in leadership, software development life cycles (SDLC) as well as knowledge in frontend and backend development. As part of testing and deploying new features, I was exposed, and learned to work with software development tools, such as Git, Docker and the Django framework. While software development during the pandemic has been challenging, my team was able to take advantage of having people in different time zones, to collaborate effectively and release features on time.I enjoyed my experience and my team at KyFlex. During the internship, I was able to understand more about my strength as well as opportunities to improve my skills in software development.";
