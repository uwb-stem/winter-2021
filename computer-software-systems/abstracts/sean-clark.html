            let input = "What: During my internship as a Knowledge Analyst at Costco I worked heavily in the Knowledge database. I developed processes and procedures to produce reports for upper management on the Knowledge documentation for Service Desk team members. <br/><br/>Why: Costco's Knowledge team lacked the automation processes and reporting capabilities which I was able to facilitate and work together with the team to streamline their current processes. <br/><br/>Result: I developed a Servicenow dashboard with 7 reports querying different databases to show metrics to upper management and teams. I assisted in AS400 code to help Service Desk team members inputs. Lastly, I automated the google mail merge to update all of Costco's IT notify when they have Knowledge documents in draft status.Significance: By producing the Knowledge metric dashboard, the Knowledge team now has visual metrics to view every day to see status on current situations. Also by automating the mail merge it has cleaned up the Knowledge Database. Assisted to further improve Costco's current IT Reimagined process by automating tasks and creating visuals for future teams. ";
