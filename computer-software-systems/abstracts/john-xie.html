Genemod is a started based in Seattle, WA, that seeks to revolutionizethe biotech industry with a more moderncloud-based data management approach. My goal was to learn more about the software development life cycle (SDLC), work on Genemod's web software through various small projects that provides ownership and high impact, and gain valuable experiences in the industry. During my internship, I used the React JavaScript framework, HTML, and Sass for the front-end and Django REST framework, Python, PostgreSQL, and SQLite for the back-end. I implemented reusable web components, developed several critical features and fixed multiple bugs for their codebase. I primarily worked on the front-end using React to develop the user interface with projects like the team management portal, the activity tracking modules, and the inventory tracking modules. I learned to design, develop, and produce high quality user interfaces, collaborate in a remote environment, and also improve usability by focusing on making the best customer experience possible.
