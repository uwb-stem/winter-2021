            let input = "My capstone was focused on creating a program for the Boys and Girls Club athleticdepartment. Over the past ten weeks, I worked to develop an application that could be used byBoys and Girls Club athletic directors to help manage and ease all the work that they do. Asathletic directors, they have to manage and file the information of the players that participate insports, logging this information either on paper or into Excel. They also have to create andmanage different teams, creating schedules and to help run a variety of leagues at a time. Ideveloped a program in C# centered around all of the needs in running leagues. This entailsbeing able to create teams and fill them with players. lt also involves creating a schedule andkeeping track of team records in terms of standings. This application gives the user the abilityto run the same operations that they did before this program, just a lot'more efficiently. Icreated a SQL database in MySQL that manages everything used in the program from theplayer information, their guardian info, to managing teams, their schedule as well as teamstandings allwithin the database. Creating this program gives me a chance to give back to anon-profit organization who has given a lot to me and who are behind on the timestechnologically. Overall, this project gave me the opportunity to gain professional experience indeveloping a program for a client as well as building my repertoire in learning how to developin new environments.";
