            let input = "Logisq is a software development startup company that was founded 3 years ago. During my internship there I worked on their current product which is a decision-making application called Thinkbar. In the process I learned a variety of new skills including coding JavaScript futures and new tools including git and android studio. My main goals were to write test automation scripts, improve app performance and create notifications. My accomplishments included test automation which fully tested all the features of the app on both web and android. I improved app performance by reducing the number of calls to the mid-tier which allowed data to load faster. Lastly, I successfully added notifications that appear on the android app. ";
