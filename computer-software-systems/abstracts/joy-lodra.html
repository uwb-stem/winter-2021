Bootstrap provides a library of design components, such as buttons, text boxes, search bars, navigation bars, and many other components with a standard look-and-feel. Implementation in Sass allows the website design to be responsive on multiple devices, including smartphones, tablets, and PCs. <br/><br/>In addition to working on the frontend components, I also collaborated with the backend team to implement functionalities for back-end and front-end connection using Axios framework to make the HTTP requests. The function that we implemented combined the endpoints from the back-end, with the user inputs received from the front-end to be saved. <br/><br/>This internship helped improve my technical skills, learn to work closely with other developers, and improve my communication skills to become a better team player.";

            // let found = input.match(regex);
            // let foundstr = found.toString();
            // let linebreak = ".<br/><br/>"
            // let replacement = linebreak.concat(foundstr.substr(-1)) ;
