            let input = "Oracle's Linux and Virtualization team is responsible for delivering on premise and cloud solutions for enterprise level server requirements. Products include ZFS and NAS storage, server management software, x86 servers, and ethernet adapters. Since these products are designed to last for decades, the websites marketing these products tend to be old and filled with outdated documentation, updates, and newsletters.During this internship I was to modernize these websites' design according to the 'Redwood' branding, while preserving only the relevant information. I was also given the supplementary task of modernizing several Excel based forms. For website creation, I used Oracle Content and Experience, a web-based interface for fast and simple website creation, pre-loaded with Oracle design templates and UI components. For form revision I used Oracle VisualBuilder, a drag-and-drop app development platform, and Oracle APEX, another development platform that runs on Oracle databases.The revision process was first understanding the content in which this form/site lives and then familiarizing myself with the tools I'd be using. I'd then repeat the process of eliciting user requirements and implementing them until the project manager was happy. By the end of my internship I had revised six websites and three different forms. My final week the forms and sites were in the process of being pushed to live.";

                let replacement = linebreak.concat(foundstr.substr(-1));
