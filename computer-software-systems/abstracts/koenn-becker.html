            let input = "CloudWatch Logs is an AWS service that helps developers monitor their applications. It has powerful features that allow people to view and query application logs, or create alerts whencertain log messages are found. It also allows engineers to create metric dashboards to track the occurrences of specific log messages over time. One of the service's main features is a custom query language, much like SQL, to search for logs on any conditions which makes finding desired logs faster.During my internship, my task was to improve the error message system for the query editor. Before my task, errors were only displayed after a customer attempted to run their query, making a request to the backend to find errors. Additionally, the errors that were returned were generic and didn't provide information about which line the error was in. I implemented a grammar parser to find syntactical errors in the query editor in real-time so customers could easily fix their queries. Instead of receiving a generic error when the customer tried to run a query, they could view errors with highlights and contextual messages as they wrote the query. This new feature helps customers to learn the language faster from helpful error messages and saves them money because they don't have to pay to run a query that they aren't aware is invalid.";

            if (found) {
                let foundstr = found.toString();
                let linebreak = ".<br/><br/>"
                let replacement = linebreak.concat(foundstr.substr(-1));
                output = input.replace(regex, replacement);
            } else {
                output = input;
