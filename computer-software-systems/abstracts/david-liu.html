Market research companies charge high rates to collect and market products based on your user information. The application I've developed is simple to use, requires no user registration, doesn't collect any information, and is free of charge. Utilizing general information available on social media platforms I've implemented a way to predict a customers interest via the Apriori algorithm. By garnering a large and relevant dataset from user profiles, the algorithm predicts user interest based on a statistical model of what previous users are already interested in. The web application I've developed encapsulates all these characteristics in a hassle free experience to serve your best interests in mind both privately and generally.";
