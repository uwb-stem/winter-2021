This mobile application was built using Xamarin technology provided by Microsoft, and encompassed many stages in its life including research, design, development, and testing. Following the advice of my faculty advisor and sponsors throughout this project, I brought the application to life feature by feature, and after these 9 weeks have a working alpha build of the product that demonstrates all the main features that this app will feature on full release in the future. My work on this project has helped me understand how mobile development works and has laid the foundation on which I will work on future developments, first and foremostly including bringing this app to the market.";
