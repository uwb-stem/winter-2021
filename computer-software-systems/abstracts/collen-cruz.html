However, these changes are unannounced to their customer base leading to multiple accounts of misinformation. This project is designed to provide Noble Palace clarity while simultaneously adding scalability to their business through the design, implementation, and deployment of a dedicated database and personalized website. The website intends to provide customers with all the necessary information needed as well as additional functionality that may prove to be useful to their users, all while maintaining customer convenience. The outcome of this project has produced a website utilizing a dual database design implemented with HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, and Javascript.";
