            let input = "During my internship at Techlent Inc, I developed several web services to facilitate SQL and Python trainings. Throughout, I worked with a small team of software developers and participated in daily standups. My role in this team was a full-stack developer. I mainly used Python Flask Framework to build microservices that allow users to practice their coding skills. After developing the microservices with auto-grading and performance analysis functionalities, the time cost for question reviews is significantly reduced to 10%. After the services were completed, I encapsulated PostgreSQL databases and practice services into Docker containers. For more efficient use of system resources, I learned to deploy the web services to Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and connected it with Techlent Platform. My current job is learning end to end testing. I am planning to set up an automatic test service with Team city so that the development team can monitor and analyze the performance of the entire platform.";
